# Insomni'hack CTF 2015 - Mobile - insomnidroid part 1

Hi Girlz,

I was yesterday night with D.J. Paris and this other girl. You know, this girl with blond hair. I found a Samsung phone on the floor (or maybe it was in her pocket) and I am sure there are interesting things inside it. Unfortunately, the device is encrypted. I know you are the best hackers in the universe, so please, please, please have a look.

I have made a bit-by-bit copy of the storage.

The device is a Samsung W (GT-I8150) and apparently it runs the Cyanogen flavour of Android KitKat.

IMPORTANT: You can solve this challenge with an Android device or emulator but also WITHOUT.
