# Insomni'hack CTF 2015 - Mobile - iBadMovie Part 2

Hi HackLady,

Thank you for the password. Apparently, the app is decrypting something, maybe a secret. Unfortunately, I just broke my iDevice and I don't have enough money to buy a new one (also because I keep my money to buy a new gold iWatch. Oh my gosh, they are so nice!). Can you help me, please!

IMPORTANT: You can solve this challenge with an Android device or emulator but also WITHOUT.
