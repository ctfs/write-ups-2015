# Insomni'hack CTF 2015 - Network - Time to leak

I have his IP address so I can locate the suspect in a 10cm area... But I'm
sure there's a way of remotely extracting the flag from his computer. Maybe
reverse scripting the packets with the custom Trojan can do the trick. But
he has a 7th generation firewall so I may fail... If only as was half as
31337 as the guy who did this.... Maybe I should try to reproduce it.
