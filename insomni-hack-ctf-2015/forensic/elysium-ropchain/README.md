# Insomni'hack CTF 2015 - Forensic - Elypsium Ropchain

This task is a mix between memory exploitation and forensic...

Most of you exploited the elysium binaries in an elegant way during the Teaser !
But we want to understand what did the real exploit from the movie.
Please find the attached pcap and binaries

WARNING ! The flag format is not respected in this task. Don't worry, it's still a little l33T sentence (I just forgot to put INS{} around it).
