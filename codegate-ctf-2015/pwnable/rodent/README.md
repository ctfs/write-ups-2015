**Category:** Pwnable + Sandbox
**Points:** 800
**Solves:** TODO
**Description:** 

> I found some ancient file server, can you have a look?
> Server : 54.178.144.54
> Port : TCP 7777
> 
> -- add
> We have added a new binary for the second stage of rodent,
> hopefully this one should be a little easier to talk to.   
> The challenge could probably have been solved even without
> this fix, but just to be sure we added ~sandbucket/sandbucket_new.
