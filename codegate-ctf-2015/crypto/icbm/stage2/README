Welcome to stage 2 :)

We lost the launch codes! There's still one test server hooked up that has
them (you are connected to it). We have a debug version of the binary (which
has test versions of the key) and the test blob that the server uses.

Can you recover the launch codes?

nc localhost 9990

You'll want to grab a copy of the files in stage2/:
neutered_icbm_server     - Binary (with fake keys)
icbm_test_blob       - Blob used by the real server
password_to_this_account - Who knows (but ssh is enabled)
