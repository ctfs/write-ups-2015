Wow, can they get anymore cryptic? xP
First task: Figure out the title

>aGFtcHduZXIz > Base64 > hampwner3

Looks like a username. Let's use our google-fu and check out the results.
We find a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/hampwner3) , a [RoosterTeeth](http://roosterteeth.com/hampwner3) and a [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/hampwner3) ...

Trying the Youtube and RoosterTeeth doesn't get us anywhere, but the Quizlet contains a clue... Sir hampwner3's [spanish quiz](http://quizlet.com/11856164/spanish-cards-flash-cards/) has a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlcTNS2TUhg) as the last term. 

Navigating to the video, we see Lux Ion's comment ...
>Wow cool video! フラグはハムです。﻿

This roughly translates to ...
> Flag is ham.

## Flag
>ham
