## Writeup

The program was decompiled and ran through several IDAs to attempt to figure out its purpose, which after a bit of digging was to shut-down Windows. Alternately if one opened the program as a txt. there was a line that said CRASH WINDOWS.EXE, which could be confirmed due to a Blue Screen Of Death(BSOD) occuring after the program was run. After the multiple people complained about BSOD the admins posted a note to the problem (seen above). One was to guess the name of the program into the submit box.
