## Writeup
This was a recon problem. The user was suppose to recognize (or research) the varibales given: ```highlighting```, ```expiration```, and ```exposure```. The user would eventually stumble upon [Pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/), which the flag would've be found inside one of its pasties. We discover this as when we make a new paste, the url ends up being a random string of characters. Our title is much like one of these, and when we paste it in to see if there's a paste with that url, we get the flag.
