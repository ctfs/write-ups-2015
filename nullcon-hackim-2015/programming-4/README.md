>
>Consider a character set of size m, M = {a, b, c .. A, C, ... 1, 2..}. How many words of exactly length n, call it F, you can construct, assuming that each word will not use same character at two different places?
>
>For example, consider M = {a, b, c} and n = 3
>
>1. aba, bbc are not allowed.
>2. abc, bac, cab are allowed
>
>In order to make it more challenging, each position in the word can have only predefined characters in M. Iron Man has got following image as a clue.
>
