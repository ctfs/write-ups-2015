> "HMAC MD5 or HMAC SHA1 are sooo obsoletes and sooo old. And they are clunky and sooo slooow! That is why, from today, we are introducing to the world a new HMAC algorithm. The best one invented ever : it's light, it's fast and it's secure, well it's the BHE or short for 'Best Hash Ever'." (C.E.C. - Cryptography Experts Company)
