> A less than four characters number, bigger than 999?Maybe the bug is elsewhere. : 25

## Write-up

Given the [php source code](./52.10.107.64\:8002/index.txt), we see that we need an input that is less than 3 chars and get beyond `is_numeric`.

The solution to this problem is using float numbers, e.g. `http://52.10.107.64:8002/?password=1e3`.

The flag is `B4SE10_IS_F0R_LOSERS`.
