## Write-up

We see in the github repo that there are [several commits](https://github.com/backdoor-ctf/TIM/commits/master), each having an ASCII character commit message of length 2 up until the last commit, which just says `Adds flag`.

After joining the commit messages to one, beginning at the oldest commit, we see a hint:

```bash
echo 4a6f696e2066697273742074776f2063686172616374657273206f66206561636820636f6d6d6974207368613120464c4147 | xxd -r -p
Join first two characters of each commit sha1 FLAG
```

We do exactly what the hint tells us to do and receive the flag:

```bash
$ git rev-list --all | grep -v '^00' | tail -r -n+33 | while read c; do echo -n ${c::2}; done
75[...]
```

Note that there is a padding to confuse people, which is indicated by commits beginning with `00`:

```bash
$ git rev-list --all

```

The flag is not printed here, since this is a long lived CTF.
