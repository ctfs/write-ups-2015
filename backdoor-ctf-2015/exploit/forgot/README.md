> Fawkes has been playing around with Finite State Automaton lately. While exploring the concept of implementing regular expressions using FSA he thought of implementing an email-address validator.
> 
> Recently, Lua started to annoy Fawkes. To this, Fawkes, challenged Lua to a battle of wits. Fawkes promised to reward Lua, only if she manages to transition to a non-reachable state in the FSA he implemented. The replication can be accessed [here](ttp://hack.bckdr.in/FORGOT/forgot-724a09c084a9df46d8555bf77612e612.tar.gz).
