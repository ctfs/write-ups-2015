**Description:**

> Yet another license manager trying to protect a propietary application. The main application calls it with a challenge '84563472956326492361085746284624', the license key, and expects a response that is internally called a 'flag'. I wonder if the've implemented it securely with real crypto or it's just some crap hidden behind a bit of security through obscurity. Only one way to find out...
