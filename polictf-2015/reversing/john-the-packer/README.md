# PoliCTF 2015: John the Packer

**Category:** Reversing
**Points:** 350
**Solves:** 50
**Description:**

> John's greatest skill is to pack everything and everywhere with everyone. He doesn't want that someone reverse his super secret program. So he wrote a magic packing system. Can you show to John that his packing system is not a good anti-reversing solution? N.B. Unfortunately John The Packer has multiple solution, so if you have a solution that is not accepted by the scoreboard (but is accepted by the binary) please contact an OP on IRC
