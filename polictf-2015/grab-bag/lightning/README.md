# PoliCTF 2015: Lightning

**Description:**

> You work as a security consultant, and one day a company calls you to solve a curious problem: after one night the company building was hit by a lightning, the vault could no longer be opened with the code, which is 0994. Unfortunately, the vault control hardware is inside the vault itself. You start building a breadboard prototype of the vault circuit, and after a lot of modeling and experiments, you come to the conclusion that the lightning has caused a "stuck at 1" fault on pin 14 of IC6. Based on the circuit diagram you come up with a code that could open the faulty vault. The flag is the concatenation of what appears on the display, and what you have to type in the keyboard. N.B. Flag is not in the format flag{.}
