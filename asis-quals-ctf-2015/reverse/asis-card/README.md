**Description:**

> hey, we've got a problem here, there's a secret data in some smart card but we couldn't access to it. It's so important to us. data.bin is the dumped card's data. also we have a binary file scardprovider which we took in some way(believe me you don't want to know how). It seems to be the main part but we couldn't run it. Could you please take a look at [these](http://tasks.asis-ctf.ir/ASIS_Card_432a726a8ab38d704befb777b7bfe346)?
